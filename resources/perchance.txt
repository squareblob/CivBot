twist

  and the admins have banned all people involved
  and a Maester wrote a book about it ^1/3
  and hired [player] to e-lawyer for them
  and hired Crimeo to e-lawyer for them ^1/10
  and hired The Hobbyist to e-lawyer for them ^1/10
  and a trial was requested in Mount Augusta
  and someone made mapart of it
  and [player] tried to blackmail them
  and a Reddit post about this attracted more people to play Civ
  and they have no intention with complying with botting rules
  and they became really good allies after that
  and the scheme turned out to be cringe roleplay
  and [player] lost discord admin privileges
  and then they met up irl
  and then they yelled at each other on the subreddit
  and then they joined a terrorist cell
  and now there's a CivBot command for this
  and now there's a {15-500} comment thread about it on the subreddit

  and now [player] has confessed their love for [player]
  and all screenshots have been leaked to [website]
  but at least we have [plugin] ^2
  but instead they rebranded, and everything's ok now
  but it's fine because none of them existed in the first place
  without checking /tps
  which made a big dent in the TPS
  which caused another year-long war
  just before the server TPS grinded to a halt
  then their DMs were leaked
  while Teal was spending the server money on shoes
  - this was apparently a reason why [player] quit
  after figuring out a new way to get up these giant cliffs
