twist
  and [player] reviewed this from a squareblobist lens
  and this apparently led to the server shutting down
  and then everyone laughed
  and the admins have banned all people involved
  and a Maester wrote a book about it 
  and hired [player] to e-lawyer for them ^1/2
  and hired Crimeo to e-lawyer for them ^1/10
  and hired The Hobbyist to e-lawyer for them ^1/10
  and a trial was requested in Mount Augusta
  and someone made mapart of it
  and [player] tried to blackmail them
  and a Reddit post about this attracted more people to play Civ
  and they have no intention with complying with botting rules
  and they became really good allies after that
  and the scheme turned out to be cringe roleplay
  and [player] lost discord admin privileges
  and then they met up irl
  and then they yelled at each other on the subreddit
  and then they joined a terrorist cell
  and now there's a CivBot command for this
  and now there's a {15-750} comment thread about it on the subreddit
  and now there's a massive bgbba rant post
  and now every cactus farm on the server is worldedited out
  and now they're in the Hallow quote collection
  and now [player] is no longer a superfriend
  and now [player] ascended to superfriend
  and now essence costs have been doubled
  and now there's like {100-700} messages spamming #general about it
  and now they all hate each other
  and now they're worshipped as a god
  and now everyone is perma pearled
  and now the exchange rate is {5-60} iron to 1 diamond
  and now they've crashed [plugin]
  and now there are {3-150} `@everyone` pings
  and now [player] has pledged blind loyalty to [player]
  and all screenshots have been leaked to [website]
  but at least we have [plugin] ^2
  but instead they rebranded, and everything's ok now
  but it's fine because none of them existed in the first place
  without checking /tps
  which made a big dent in the TPS
  which caused another year-long war
  just before the server TPS grinded to a halt
  then their DMs were leaked
  while Teal was spending the server money on shoes ^1/3
  —this was apparently a reason why [player] quit
  after figuring out a new way to get up these giant cliffs
  but [player] told them to shut the fuck up
  but it turns out it was all made up
  —Thank you for six years of entertainment
  which is quite [player]ist
  because it was funny
  and [player] said he's never touching civ again

  and now [player] is taking off work to break the vault
  and all of [nation]'s citizens transfer citizenship
  and [player] gets a vaccine
